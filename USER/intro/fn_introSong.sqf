0:18 This land is mine
0:30 God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
0:45 And when the morning sun   - tractor 

Reveals her hills and plains
Then I see a land
Where children can run free   - ziegen / sheep 
So take my hand

And walk this land with me
And walk this lovely land with me

Though I am just a man
When you are by my side

With the help of God
I know I can be strong

Though I am just a man
When you are by my side

With the help of God
I know I can be strong


To make this land our home
If I must fight, I'll fight
To make this land our own
Until I die, this land is mine
